# Vehicle-Detector-and-Counter
vehicle-counting-using-python-yolo
Vehicle counting in a conjusted traffic road where background subtraction gives lower performance.
Our project is to design a program that can detect the number of vehicles moving through a particular place.
In motion detector our project would detect the motion in a frame and would cover it up as fast with a square frame.
The program we will be developing is to detect object of interest(i.e reference frame) in real time and to keep tracking of the same object.

## Modules
This project use YOLOv3 for Vehicle detection and SORT(Simple Online and Realtime Tracker) for vehicle tracking.
